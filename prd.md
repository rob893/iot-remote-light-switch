| FR001          | Turn the light switch on                 | As a user, I want to be able to remotely turn on a light switch using a web site I can access on my phone.                                  | The website should expose a button to turn on the light switch. This should send an http request to the server to change the state which then the iot device should periodically poll the server for current state and then turn the switch on.    |
| FR002          | Turn the light switch off                | As a user, I want to be able to remotely turn off a light switch using a web site I can access on my phone.                                 | The website should expose a button to turn off the light switch. This should send an http request to the server to change the state which then the iot device should periodically poll the server for current state and then turn the switch off.  |
| FR003          | Know if the light is currently on or off | As a user, I want to be able to know if the ligth is currently on or off using a website on my phone                                        | The website should tell the user the current state of the light switch. The state can be gotten from the server.                                                                                                                                   |
| FR004          | Secure the state                         | As a user, I want only someone who knows the password to turn the switch on and off. The user needs to be able to type password in website. | The website should allow user to input password which will be used to to send to server. Server should check for password before allowing state change.                                                                                            |
| FR005          | UX should be cool and awesome            | As a user, I want the UI to look super cool and awesome.                                                                                    | Use tailwind css to make the UI look great. It should always be dark mode but there should be a button to swap to light mode but when clicked, should call the user a NERD for wanting to use light mode. UI should also be written in Typescript. |
